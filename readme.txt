Show a timer that counts down until your orders ship for the day. Daily delivery countdown timer, set each day individually, hide or show weekends.

== Description ==

The purpose for this plugin is simple, to let your customers know how much time is left before your webshop ships out the orders of the day. By creating a scarcity effect, with time being what is limited here, it might be possible to create a better conversion rate, by convincing the website visitors exactly when you will ship your orders.
